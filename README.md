# Defox - NFTs Explorer Website

An open-source NFT search explorer website built with React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and React Hooks. This website allows users to browse and search for NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain networks.

## Installation

To run this website, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2.  Install dependencies for the client and server by running the following command in the client and server directory respectively:

    `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Running the Website

To run the website, you will need to start both the client and server simultaneously. This can be done using the [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) npm package. To start both the client and server, run the following command in the project root directory:

`npm dev:both` or `yarn dev:both`

This will start the client on port 3000 and the server on port 4000. You can access the website by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
